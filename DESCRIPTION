Description: HiCLegos creates a flexible framework for storing and accessing high-resolution Hi-C data through HDF files. As of now, it allows import of Hi-C data through various formats such as the 2D matrix format or a generalized n-column table formats. In terms of access, HiCLegos offers functions to retrieve values from genomic loci separated by a certain distance, or the ability to fetch matrix subsets using word alike terminology. HiCLegos offers the ability to fetch multiple matrix subsets using fewer calls (complex selections using HDF dataspaces). It offers the capacity to store GenomicRanges that may be associated to a particular Hi-C experiment, to do basic ranges overlap (any, within) with the Hi-C experiment associated Ranges object and also to store any metadata that users may think to be relevant for their Hi-C experiment.
