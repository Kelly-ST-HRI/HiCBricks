Package: HiCBricks
Title: Framework for Storing and Accessing Hi-C Data Through HDF Files
Version: 1.3.994
Description: A flexible framework for storing and accessing high-resolution Hi-C data through HDF files. HiCBricks allows import of Hi-C data through various formats such as the 2D matrix format or a generalized n-column table formats. In terms of access, HiCBricks offers functions to retrieve values from genomic loci separated by a certain distance, or the ability to fetch matrix subsets using word alike terms. HiCBricks will at a later point offer the ability to fetch multiple matrix subsets using fewer calls. It offers the capacity to store GenomicRanges that may be associated to a particular Hi-C experiment, to do basic ranges overlap (any, within) with the Hi-C experiment associated Ranges object and also to store any metadata that users may think to be relevant for their Hi-C experiment. Finally, you can do TAD calls with LSD and create pretty heatmaps.
